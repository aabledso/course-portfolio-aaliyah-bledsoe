        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-canes-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I made the following changes to the webpage using developer tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed border to 10px solid pink</li>
            <li>Modified font-family to Cursive</li>
            <li>Changed HTML texts to 24K Gold Labubu combo and a 67 combo. I also added extra fries to the combo on the
                left.</li>
            <li>Changed background color to black and font to white</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>I made these changes to better understand how HTML and CSS interact. While they are fairly simple
            changes, I learned that some changes won't display due to them being overridden by other styles and
            lines of code. Overall, I think this was a very cool assignment and look forward to applying what I've
            learned when it comes to making my own personal websites.</p>
