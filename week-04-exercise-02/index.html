            These are songs that get me through the week. Each one has a special place in my heart and mind, and I find
            myself motivated by each in different ways. Whether it's a dreadful Moday or an upbeat Friday, these tracks
            help set the tone for my day and keep me moving forward.

                    This song is my Sunday Song. I feel like the cover perfectly depicts how I feel every Sunday when I
                    have a full week of
                    work ahead of me. I really like that the beat is so uplifting while the lyrics are a little sad. My
                    mixed emotions every
                    Sunday night are captured by the feeling this song gives me. <em>**just vibe!**</em>

                    This song is my Monday Song. I'm still waking up on Monday. It's usually my longest day and takes
                    the most of my energy. This song is always there for me and I'm familiar with it. I like the slow
                    beat and it reminds me of a slow Monday. I'm getting hype, but not quite there yet. <em>**little

                    This is my Tuesday song. Tuesdays are usually a bit more productive for me compared to Monday, but
                    I'm still not fully in the groove of the week. "The Motto" has an energetic vibe that helps me push
                    through the day. The catchy beat and memorable lyrics keep me motivated as I take on whatever
                    Tuesday throws at me. <em>**more energetic bop side to side, slowly getting groovy**</em>

                    This is my Wednesday song. Wednesdays are the midpoint of the week, and this song gives me the boost
                    I need to keep going. The upbeat tempo and catchy chorus help me stay focused and energized as I
                    tackle my tasks for the day. It's a reminder that I'm halfway through the week and can start looking
                    forward to the weekend. It's my way of keeping my energy up from Tuesday. <em>**full on groove, head
                        bobbing, shoulders moving, maybe a little dance**</em>

                    This is my Thursday song. I'm back at square one. Why can't Thursday cease to exist? It should be
                    Friday already. I'm dreading that I have another day left of the week. This song is on the sadder
                    side and goes well with my mood for Thursdays. The heartfelt lyrics and gentle melody allow me to
                    take a moment for myself amidst the busyness of the week. <em>**feeling less groovy, but still
                        swaying a bit**</em>

                    This is my Friday song. Fridays are my favorite day of the week because the weekend is coming up.
                    You
                    probably won't actually catch me in the club on a Friday night, but this song gives me that vibe.
                    The
                    energetic beat and empowering lyrics help me kick off the weekend with confidence and excitement.
                    It's
                    my way of celebrating the end of the workweek and looking forward to being able to sleep in. The guy
                    saying "FTCU" in the background is really the only part of this song that I like but it still gets
                    me
                    hype either way. I've recovered from my dreadful Thursday!!<em>**full on dance mode, maybe even a
                        couple
                        jumps**</em>

                <p class="description">
                    This is my Saturday song. Saturdays are my favorite day of the week. I have nothing due other than
                    three 20 questiong math assignment, but we'll let that slide. I can finally relax and do whatever I
                    want. "Adore You" has a fun and carefree vibe that I love to listen to with my sunroof down on my
                    way to Bucees. The upbeat tempo and catchy chorus make it the perfect song for my Saturday
                    adventures. It's a reminder to not take life too seriously. <em>**singing along at the top of my
                        lungs while driving with the sunroof down as people look at me like I've lost my mind**</em>
