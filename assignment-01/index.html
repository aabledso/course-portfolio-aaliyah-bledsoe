        <li>5. Lavender Matcha Latte w/ Lavender Soft Top</li>
        <h2>Lavender, Matcha</h2>
        <p> Personally, I love a good lavender match latte. This drink is really lacking in the "matcha" flavor, but the
            lavender soft top somewhat makes up for it. Definitely wouldn't recommend as a first choice for matcha, but
            if it's late at night and all the coffee shops are closed, this is a good alternative. </p>
        <li>4. Kick in Da Face Rebel Double Blended</li>
        <h2>Pomegranate, Peach, Cherry, Passion Fruit</h2>
        <p> A fun drink filled with fruity flavors. A great choice for those who enjoy a sweet and tangy taste. Perfect
            for a hot summer day in Texas.</p>
        <li>3. Annihilator Iced</li>
        <h2>Espresso, Chocolate Macadamia Nut</h2>
        <p> Nothing exravagant, but a safe choice for those who enjoy a nutty flavor with their espresso. Ask for extra
            shots of espresso if you want a stronger flavor. Recommmended for mornings when you need a pick-me-up.</p>
        <li>2. Golden Eagle</li>
        <h2>Espresso, Caramel, Vanilla</h2>
        <p> This is a classic. If you're a fan of espresso, caramel, and vanilla, this drink is perfect for you. I
            suggest this drink to everyone who is new to the Dutch Bros life.</p>
        <li>1. Dinosaur Egg Rebel Double Blended</li>
        <h2>Blue Raspberry, Almond, Strawberry, White Chocolate</h2>
        <p> This is flavor is my number one all time favorite. If you like blue raspeberry then you'll love this drink.
            Although the almond and white chocolate flavors may seem a little questionable, they add a nice balance to
            the sweetness of the blue raspberry and strawberry. </p>
