            <li>
                <h2>Dinosaur Egg Rebel Double Blended</h2>
                <p> This flavor is my number one all time favorite. If you like blue raspeberry then you'll love
                    this
                    drink. Although the almond and white chocolate flavors may seem a little questionable, they add a
                    nice
                    balance to the sweetness of the blue raspberry and strawberry.</p>
            <li>
                <h2>Golden Eagle</h2>
                <p> This is a classic. If you're a fan of espresso, caramel, and vanilla, this drink is perfect for you.
                    I
                    suggest this drink to everyone who is new to the Dutch Bros life.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Annihilator Iced</h2>
                <p> Nothing exravagant, but a safe choice for those who enjoy a nutty flavor with their espresso. Ask
                    for
                    extra shots of espresso if you want a stronger flavor. Recommended for mornings when you need a
                    pick-me-up.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Kick in Da Face Rebel Double Blended</h2>
                <p> A fun drink filled with fruity flavors. A great choice for those who enjoy a sweet and tangy taste.
                    This
                    drink is perfect for a hot summer day in Texas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Lavender Matcha Latte w/ Lavender Soft Top</h2>
                <p> Personally, I love a good lavender matcha latte. This drink is really lacking in the "matcha"
                    flavor,
                    but
                    the lavender soft top somewhat makes up for it. Definitely wouldn't recommend as a first choice for
                    matcha, but if it's late at night and all the coffee shops are closed, this is a good alternative.
